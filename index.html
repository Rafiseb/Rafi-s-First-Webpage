        <h1 class="paragraph"> My Life So Far
</h1>
<h2 class="paragraph text">  My name is Rafael Bustamante. I have one sister and currently live in Queens, NY with my parents. Living somewhat far away from my school in Manhattan is surely an obstacle everyday. However, it's all the things I do in school makes my everyday obstacles definitely worthwhile. My classes encourages deep, insightful thinking and definitely pushes to become the best person I can be. <br> <br> After my classes I completely change my mindset into what I call an "all soccer" mindset. I play for the most prestigious high school soccer program in all of New York City. I'm 5'4 and not very proud of it. Reason why is because my height can be a disadvantage every time I step on the soccer field. It's a challenge to compete in aerial duels and sometimes to play against much taller opponents. However, it's a great privilege to be the captain of the soccer team in only my junior year.    However, being captain comes with immense pressure as this year the team has to win the cup, due to our unfortunate lost in the semis the year before. This high school has won 15 NYC championships and losing is not an option we can afford. Being able to balance both my soccer and school life may be difficult, but I still enjoy every single day and live it to the fullest. :) </h2>
